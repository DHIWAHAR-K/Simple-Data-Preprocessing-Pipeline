# Simple Data Preprocessing Pipeline in Python

## Overview

This Python script demonstrates the setup of a simple data preprocessing pipeline, an essential step in preparing data for machine learning models. The provided script outlines a basic data preprocessing workflow, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. Explore this script to understand the fundamental steps involved in cleaning and preparing a dataset for machine learning.

## Script Components

- **Importing Libraries:** Initial steps to import necessary Python libraries (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn).
- **Loading Dataset:** Code for loading a sample dataset or replacing it with your own data.
- **Handling Missing Values:** Strategies for dealing with missing data (e.g., imputation or removal).
- **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Techniques for converting categorical variables into a format suitable for machine learning models.
- **Scaling Numerical Features:** Normalizing or standardizing numerical features to ensure uniform scales.
- **Output Display:** Displaying the preprocessed dataset for inspection.

## Running the Script

1. Open and run the Python script (`preprocessing.ipynb`) in a Python environment.
2. The script will load the sample dataset (or replace it with your own) and preprocess the data.
3. Inspect the output to see the cleaned and prepared dataset.

## Customization

- Replace the sample dataset with your own data by modifying the loading section.
- Experiment with different strategies for handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- Adapt the preprocessing steps based on the requirements of your machine learning project.
